well id gotten judy pregnant i still dont know how that happened
you dont know how that happened your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy

anyway were really excited about our wedding plans and well i guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund
what
you tell her jack i cant do it
what happened you still have the monica wedding fund dont you
we have it only now we call it the beach house
after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one

grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion
okay  ow owohoh
was it not painfree
no it was painful oh my god  they should call it painzine now with a little wax

well i was going to but after i talked to you i talked to joey
what did what did he say
basically he told me to get over myself and just do it ya know
so i though about what you said and i though about what he said and well his way i get to have sex tonight so
oh great
we couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck
okay stop it phoebe youre getting me all tingly
all i could think of was yknow is he gonna kiss me is he gonna kiss me
and did he
im a lady monica i dont kiss and tell but this hickey speaks for itself
okayokay i got it i got it
i just like him so much that i just feel like ive had 10 drinks today and ive only had six
oh i havent had that feeling since i first started going out with chandler
wow im never gonna have that feeling again am i
you sound like a guy
no a guy would be saying im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else
oh my god
im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else
ive been so busy planning the wedding that i forgot about all the things that id be giving up

chandler phoebes hogging the game

right
i mean imim crazy about pete and i know that we want the same things and when i thought about saying yes it made me really happy
oh my god
i know  i need more pie

no that was my way of telling you
well it turns out hes incredibly sensitive he keeps a journal and he paints
he even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me
wow
yeah well hed prefer water colors but yknow he has easy access to a lot of charcoal
so then are you going to dump jason
well yeah because i have to break up with someone and okay so jason is sensitive  but now sos vince  plus vince has the body yknow
so its really just about the math
ok so its a tie again 41 to 41
ok look enough is enough
no i have just to have two more points to beat him
monica that was also true an
i cant just walk away ive put in four hours

and monica with that snort when she laughs
i mean what the hell is that thing
i accept all those flaws why cant you accept me for this

ohhh  wow he kinda takes your breath away doesnt he
hes a keeper how are you feeling
oh im fine
can i just say i really admire what youre doing just raising her all alone
oh im not doing it alone i have ross
oh sure now but what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married
well then he gets a divorce its ross
im telling you rachel listen to janice they all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family
well ithats never gonna happen with ross
oh well thats what i thought about my first husband now im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little ms new boobs
and tim i just wanna say good luck here
hey whos that
new people
what happened to the disgustingtons
theyre having their baby
its not fair ross we got here first
right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery
oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little jamie just crowning away
wow sorry so uh how are the new people
phoebe
yeah
look at that guy by the window wow
hes awfully short and i think hes talking to himself and to be completely honest hes not that good in bed
oh what is wrong with me lately
i mean its like every guy i seei mean look here
look at that guy for example i mean normally thats not someone i wouldwould be attracted to but right now with the way im feeling all i want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack
wait a second this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy right
yeah
this is completely normal around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy
really so this has happened to you
oh absolutely yeah
oh and keep in mind now i was carrying triplets so in yknow medical terms i wasi was thrice as randy
wow this explains so much last weekend i went from store to store sitting on santas lap
yeah yeah i remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of evander holyfield from a
ugh
i dont know what im going to do
i called the company that sent and ththey dont care
then i called 911 and they laughed at me if this isnt an emergency then what is
hey guys
hey
hey
i just wanted to thank you again for last night what a great party
and the guys from work had a blast
yknow one of them had never been to a bachelor party before
yeah
andand another one had never been to a party before so
so uh hey that uh that wedding ring huh man thats nice
yeah right
i was uh i was thinking i might want to pick one of those babies up for myself i might want to get one of those
that ring when my grandmother first came to this country that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her
so you might say the ring is irreplaceable
oh absolutely it has been in my family for generations and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life
so you might say its a magic ring
oh my god i didnt really believe it until you just said it
well obviously only one of us can keep dating her
obviously so how do we decide
well now letslets look at this objectively i think i should date her
uhhuh uhhuh
thats interesting but check this out i date her
yeahyeah i like that but just to go in another direction
okay okay this can go on for a while
yeah well we should order some food then
no joey look why dont why dont we just let her decide okay heyhey well
that sounds fair
maybe ill take her to that new french restaurant down the street
ah yeahwait a second now
look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date
i dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that
well sorry thats what i do on dates
all right well i guess ill just have to do what i do on dates
so lets decide on the spending limit
yeah uh a slicesix dollars
i was thinking more like a hundred
okay can i borrow 94 dollars

yes joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me
oh and rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me its amazing how she gets it right almost
iii of course i have more responsibilities than that
oh yes well theres the coffee too  rachel can carry two things at once
yes thats very good now a uh big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships especially with designers
yes i realize that
and rachel shouldnt have any problem with that the only problem might be getting a little too friendly if you know what i mean
i love working with designers
with them under them whats the difference eh rach
chandler you have an assistant right
did she call youyou told her i was sick right always tell her i am sick
chandler listen to me sweetie i know you can do this okay you have a beautiful smile

so after awhile hehe goes over to her and uh after a minute or two i see them kissing
now i know what youre thinking chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls and youre right chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls
you kissed a guy oh my god
in my defense it was dark and he was a very pretty guy

i hope its you
me too
first of all um i love you both so much and youre both so important to me

like hypothetically if phoebe were mine
yes oh
hypothetically
still
if phoebe were my maid of honor
rachel would be phoebes i would be rachels that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset
yeah thats actually a pretty good idea
yeah ill do that so who gets to be yours

because then i dont have to
well of

thats right i dont but i was i was drunk on you
okay yeah so its not gonna work
if it was would you stop hanging out with her
um then yes its cause of phoebe so you know its either her or me
you know  youre gonna be really really hard to get over
by the way the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me
oh hello liar
look iim really sorry i let go of the bike
i couldve been killed i hope you know
i know i know but can we please try it again huh i mean you were
well i would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects
phoebe
what  what the hell
all right yknow what
if you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then im sorry im just gonna have to take it back
what why
because because ititits itd be like you having this guitar  andand never playing it okay this guitar
all right if you care enough to make up that load of crap okay
great great  youre making the bike very happy
okay ross  please dont die
how could you have kept all of this from me
i was going to tell you but
but what you figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped rachel
hey i did not dump rachel  nor are we still together  can i just  why dont we just let the machine get that
hey ross its joey theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it
no no no no no iiiii need to i need to lie down
everything on your application looks really goodohh
just one last question umm are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out
oh dont worry im not really a party girl
whoa now look dont be just blurtin stuff out i want you to really think about your answers okay
you can call off the roommate search  hi ill be living here
oh dont listen to him hes just some guy who really wants the apartment but i dont think hes gonna get it
why did you take the shower curtain down
that thing was a hazard  im very safety conscious
hi
hey man how did the audition go
estelle said i didnt get it
what why joey you were so ready for it
yeah i thought so too but she said the casting people had some problems with me
no
for all i know shes trying to find me but couldnt because i kept moving around
no from now on im staying in one place
right here
well its getting late
yeah were gonna go
actually do you guys mind staying here for a while
ugh yknow umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for new york
yeah its a very large plane
thats cool
but well stay here with you
thanks guys  i really appreciate this yknow but you dont have to rub my butt
hey mel gibson and clint eastwood
theyre not a couple
ohokay i get the game now
okay look look let me ask you a question when they were doing it on stage was it like really hot
oh yeah
well okay so then youre fine
the rule is when two actors are actually doing it offstage all the sexual tension between them is gone
okay
so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about
its when the heat goes away thats when youre in trouble
really
look you guys have been to every play ive ever been in have i ever had chemistry on stage
no
noooo
ursula  wait errerr its me phoebe
oh i thought there was a mirror there okay byebye
wait a second so whats new with you
umm nothing i mean im getting married next week
and your breasts hmm
okay
umm look youre coming on a little strong
but im going to give you the benefit of the doubt because it seems the universe really wants to be together
so why dont we just start over okay
and you can just tell me about yourself
all right
okay
i write erotic novels for children
what
theyre wildly unpopular
oh my god
oh also you might be interested to know that i have a phd

all right
so uh hows she doing
the doctor says its a matter of hours
howhow are you mom

oh maybe thats it
she is unbelievable our mother is
okay relax relax
we are gonna be here for a while it looks like and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover
oh god
the fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse
oh

not just restaurants from our house
maybe
you cant
why  seriously i did not understand a word that    you said
in the hall
now ysee most people when their pets pass on they want em sorta laid out like theyre sleeping
but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose
like chasing their tail  or uh jumping to catch a frisbee

no joey she
okay so now they know that you know and they dont know that rachel knows
yes but yknow what
it doesnt matter who knows what
now enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know
then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over
its a tradition like the parade if the parade decided it was gay moved out and abandoned its entire family
yknow youre friends getting married its gotta change things
you really think it would be that different
how could it not be
i mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids
and then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a
well things change
i dont want them to move to a
itll be okay joe

mrs braverman must be out
she could be out of town maybe shell be gone for months
by then the cheesecake may have gone bad we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake
no that could kill her
well we dont want that
no so were protecting her
but we should take it

why
because i think i just heard her moving around in there
go go go go go go go go go go

now im looking at my dad thinking
hey youre not him
youre you
when they were all over you to go into your fathers pipefitting business did you cave
no

you really think so
yeah i really do
thanks chandler

emily do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding
do you my sisters teenytiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here huh

i cant ask people to do that would you ask people to do that
dont you point your pants at me
we have no choice
anywhere thats halfdecent wouldve be booked months ago ross dont you understand

so what are you saying its now or never
no im saying its now
or
theres no or in mind what is wrong with these pants
its not the pants

oh bob he was nothing compared to you i had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name
well that makes me feel so good
it was just so awkward and bumpy
bumpy

okay
whats all this about you guys fighting is this really over a room i mean that is so silly
ross we can handle this

i mean enough of the silliness
well why dont you tell her to stop being silly
okayokay
two very good points look ive known you both a long time and ive never seen either of you onemillionth as happy as youve been since youve got together

with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time
and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here
okay whatever i really havent thought about it that much

oh i gotta get to work so call me later
uh sure sure
bye guys
i mean i dont feel like i even have a girlfriend anymore
you want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend
is this about mark
oh my god
okay its not its not
oh my god i cannot keep having this same fight with you ross look urrgh maybe we should take a break
fine youre right
lets ah lets take a break  lets cool off okay lets get some frozen yoghurt or something
no a break from us
bing were all set for tonight 8 oclock
oh uh as it turns out we cant do it monica has to work
oh my exwife didnt work unless you call turning into her mother work fine tomorrow night then
oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either
oh why not
its the semifinalsof herbotchy ball tournament
whats going on bing does uh your wife have a problem with me or something
well nownow youre just talking crazy
so why cant the three of us go out together
because uhwewewe split up monica and i split up hold me
good god bing iwell i cant say im altogether surprised i saw the way she looked at you and there was no love there
and the way she looked at me pure lust
yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something can i choke ya
bing my boy were gonna get you over this
now heres the plan grab your coat were going to a strip club
oh nonono monica would freak  but to hell with that bitch
look at you all sweet and innocent sleeping like an angel    with emmas chubby little hands wrapped around ya
its    okay emma you stay asleep
 step away from the crib    i have a weapon
its okay its okay rach its me put down the scrunchy
what are you doing
well i heard emma stirring so i came to make sure she could    reach hugsy
oh oh thanks alright well now that im up im going to go    to the bathroom
there you go sweetie     this isnt over
did he call
no sorry
why why he said hed call why hasnt he called
maybe hes intimated by really smart strong successful women
sophie would you please climb out of my butt why hasnt he called rachel why
okay okay umm well ah maybe he maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss
awkward why should he feel awkward
the only person that should feel awkward is you and you didnt tell him not to call me did you
because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for there are always ways to fixthat
and youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry
i mean all im asking for is just a little emotion
is that too much to ask after six years
i mean what
areareare rachel and i not as close as you guys
i mean do we not have as much fun
dont i deserve a few tears
i mean wewe told joey he cried his eyes out
hey
i did not cry my eyes out
come on
its like the end of an era
no more jman and channies
okay i gotta ask who calls us that
do i know why were rushing
yeah yknow the ah the girlfriend i told you about last night
well it turns out she ah she wants to get back together with me

hi ohhh you got my message

ahhhh
ooh im sorry i think i think that may have missed the table
do
ah
do
ah
do you
yknow i dont understand why they didnt cry it was a beautiful speech
oh come on
hey
all that stuff you said about true love you were right i mean we did learn a lot from mom and dad
and that picture of chichi with her mischievous grin
and what you said about nana
ohh yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there
and you know what
i think she was
oh good god ross how the hell do you do it
you forget how many great songs heart had
yeah
you know barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard
so you heard it you repeated it so that must mean you wrote it
oh you guys with this joke i gotta say i know i cracked up but im not even sure i got it
what you didnt get it the doctor is a monkey
and monkeys cant write out prescriptions
you are not allowed to laugh at my joke
your joke well i think the hef would disagree which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ahdollars
i cant find garbage bags
oh i think i saw some in here
what is it
i dont know but maybe if we keep that drawer shut itll die
i cant believe were living here
you still haven’t told rachel you weren’t really  proposing
no she had the ring on she seemed so excited and then she  took her breast out
joey you have to tell her what’s going on and what did it  look like
i didn’t look at it stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it
go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out
look it’s not that easy she said she wanted to marry me i  don’t want to hurt her

chandler we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six
we said seven
we said six
the only way that i said six would be if the sevens let meet at seven not at six

well were really not that close  okay so i guess this is uh goodbye then
on no no its not goodbye im not leaving until you get on that plane
no im afraid i wont be able to make love as well as him
yeah i was going for the metaphor
yes and i was saying the actual words

i didnt know ross and you were so close
we werent but we had one class together he was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science i always remembered him
im sure that would mean a lot to him
and if heaven has a    door im sure hes pressing his ear up against it and listening intently
i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out    i guess i really missed my chance
but you didnt
im still alive
kori i know this is a big surprise for you
its a long story but the things    you just said really made my day
i mean the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people
you sick freak who does that i cant believe i had a crush on    you
did you hear that kori weston had a crush on me
well do a quick check
okay
so eight days late huh
yeah
you must be a little uncomfortable
eh just a tad
youre about 80 percent effaced so youre on your way
it still could last a little while longer
if youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along
do them
actually theyre things you can do just some home remedies but in my experience ive found that some of them are quite effective
well we are ready to try anything
okay theres an herbal tea you can drink
okay
what is wrong with emma
oh she misunderstood she thought she was moving to tulsa
anytime youre ready

that proposal at the planetarium
i know i know it was stupid

did you just make that up
no actually i thought about it when when we were going out
its how i imagined i uh i would ask you to marry me
well that wouldve been very hard to say no too
its a good thing i didnt do it because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding  okay good night
goodnight
even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up
i will think about it
thats all im askin
